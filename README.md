# What / why
An extension to auto-close tabs after they open native apps. Useful for sites like Zoom & Notion that leave stale tabs open after their desktop app has launched.

 - [Available as Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodnight-tabs/paichadkkbhdmkngdmkgmefiabjjcaai)
 - Firefox extension TBD ([GH issue](https://github.com/zchr/zoomies/issues/1))

# Changes
Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/zchr/zoomies/issues/new) with any other sites you'd want the extension to support. Please include:
 - Url of the service
 - A screenshot of the tab that you'd want closed (this way, we know what text / patterns on the page to match on)
